Notes on the lower mantle testing:
will cycle through the lower mantle parameters V and TauMR (the reference Maxwell time, i.e. the prefactor)
These are called in the Rheo_forward script from the "constants_complete_LMtest#.ini files where the lower mantle values are written in the bash script that loops over the range of values

LMtest1:
Simple test grid searching over some values of lower mantle activation volume and reference Maxwell time, assuming both are constant throughout the lower mantle.
In this run we do not adjust the reference Temp and Pressure values in the LM
conditions pertinent to the upper mantle (/experiments...)
• Activation volume = 2:2:10 (x 10^-6)
• Reference Maxwell time = logspace(1e7,1e8,6) 
• Delta = 1.04
These come from the 1D profile through the model, with rough T and P values for a depth of 1500km, in the mid mantle, well below the TZ but above the slabby bit of our model... 
• Reference Pressure    = 0.2e9    (NOT 6.25e10 Pa (62.5 GPa))
• Reference Temperature = 1173  (NOT 2020 C ==> 2293 K)

LMtest3:
Simple test grid searching over some values of lower mantle activation volume and Maxwell time at the reference, assuming both are constant throughout the lower mantle. 
Also, we DO adjust the reference Temp and Pressure values in the LM to reduce the increasingly exponential behavour of the Arrhenius function far away from the reference 
conditions pertinent to the upper mantle (/experiments...)
The difference between this and LMtest1 is just that the reference P, T have changed
• Activation volume = 2:2:10 (x 10^-6)
• Reference Maxwell time = logspace(1e7,1e8,6)
• Delta = 1.04
These come from the 1D profile through the model, with rough T and P values for a depth of 1500km, in the mid mantle, well below the TZ but above the slabby bit of our model...
• Reference Pressure    = 6.25e10 Pa (62.5 GPa)
• Reference Temperature = 2020 C ==> 2293 K

LMtest4:
Simple test grid searching over some values of lower mantle activation volume and Maxwell time at the reference, assuming both are constant throughout the lower mantle. 
We HAVE adjusted the reference Temp and Pressure values in the LM to reduce the increasingly exponential behavour of the Arrhenius function far away from the reference 
conditions pertinent to the upper mantle (/experiments...)
The difference between this and LMtest3 is that here we're using a lower mantle Delta of 0.4 (as opposed to the UM value of 1.04) based on prev. tests
• Activation volume = 2:2:10 (x 10^-6)
• Reference Maxwell time = logspace(1e7,1e8,6)
• Delta = 0.4
These come from the 1D profile through the model, with rough T and P values for a depth of 1500km, in the mid mantle, well below the TZ but above the slabby bit of our model...
• Reference Pressure    = 6.25e10 Pa (62.5 GPa)
• Reference Temperature = 2020 C ==> 2293 K
